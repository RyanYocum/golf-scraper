# golf-scraper

Support repository for the golf app.


Main.js scrapes all of the courses from a county.

jsonCombiner combines all of the separate county files into one file while converting the data into a more usable state.

jsonDatabaseEntry does just as the file name suggets, enters all of the data into the database.
